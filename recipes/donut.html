            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Making homemade glazed doughnuts is easier than you think, but requires a little patience. Ready in about 2.5 hours, these taste like doughnuts from your favorite bakery, but they’re made in the comfort of your own home. For doughnut success, follow my step-by-step photos, helpful success tips, and video tutorial. Using this same doughnut dough, you can create other flavored frosted doughnuts too!</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Yeast</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Vanilla extract</li>
                <li>Nutmeg</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The dough comes together with a mixer. You can also make the dough by hand, but it requires a bit of arm muscle. After the dough comes together in the mixing bowl, knead it for 5–7 minutes. If you’re new to yeasted doughs, my how to knead dough post and video can help with this step.</li>
                <li>In a relatively warm environment, the dough rises in about 90 minutes.</li>
                <li>Punch down the dough to release the air.</li>
                <li>Roll the dough out to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the doughnuts using a 3–3.5-inch doughnut cutter. Line 1 or 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Place doughnuts (and doughnut holes!) onto the lined baking sheet(s), then lightly cover and allow to rest for 30 minutes as you heat the oil.</li>
                <li>Using a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven and an oil thermometer, heat vegetable oil to 375°F (191°C).</li>
                <li>Working with 2–3 doughnuts at a time, cook for 1 minute on each side. Carefully remove from the oil and place onto prepared rack. Repeat with remaining doughnuts. (See my recipe note about making the doughnut holes.)</li>
                <li>Make a simple 3-ingredient glaze: just milk or cream, confectioners’ sugar, and vanilla extract. This part couldn’t be easier; literally just whisk the 3 ingredients together. Dunk each side of the warm doughnuts into the glaze. The glaze will set in about 20 minutes.</li>
